# python_Face_Detections
Face Detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates human faces in digital images or video streams. Unlike face recognition, which identifies who the person is, face detection only determines where a face is located.

This project uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and a Haar Cascade Classifier, which is a machine learning object detection algorithm trained to recognize patterns in human faces.

üé• Real-Time Detection
Captures and processes webcam video stream live

Detects multiple faces in one frame

üß† Haar Cascade Classifier
Uses haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml for efficient face detection

Easy to integrate and modify

üñºÔ∏è Rectangle Overlay
Draws a colored box around detected faces

Helps visualize detection output clearly

‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Control
Press Esc key to exit the application safely

‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
